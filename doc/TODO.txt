    resolve data type for sizeof
        its size may be up to 64-bit unsigned integer
        which might be problematic in java
        possibly add validation in native code to check that actual value fits in jlong
            throw exception in other cases
            acceptable, because huge sizes are not common
            might create a helper shared function in native code
